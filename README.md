# TC Scripts

![](https://github.com/ins1x/TC-scripts/blob/main/install/Logo.jpg)

A set of install scripts and settings for [Total Commander](https://www.ghisler.com/).  
They were used for my own builds [TotalCommander_ins[pack] and TOTALCMD_[DSTC]](https://mega.nz/folder/mjZEhYAC#2E6z-FmTfTQfGBeSOCBiJQ).  
You can use this scripts and templates in your personal TC-Repacks.
